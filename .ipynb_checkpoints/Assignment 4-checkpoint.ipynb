    "Before starting on this question, I'd like to define the following basic objects first. Firstly, i define the constants Red and Black which constitute the basis of Red-Black Trees. Secondly, I define the class RBNode which represents a Node in the Red-Black Tree. This stores the following attributes: the time (in 24h format), its ID number, its parent (self.p), left and right child, colour (red by default) and info, which will be covered later when we talk about augmenting the Red-Black Tree in order to output requests in **O(log n)**. In addition, I will store the time object, which is needed to store the airplane times. "

    "For this question, I have to solve the belief propogation problem. In this problem, I have to solve the Belief Propogation Problem using Dynamic programming. I start from the first part:\n",
    "\n",
    "**(a) Argue or justify that the problem can be solved using dynamic programming.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. This is because of the overlapping substructures of the subproblems. In other words, subproblems share subsubproblems. If dynamic programming is not used, then the algorithm becomes inefficient because we have to compute the same subsubproblem multiple times. However, dynamic programing allows us to solve these subsubproblems just once and store its answer in a table, which can be queried, making our algorithm much more efficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a concrete example, consider the undirected graph consisting of the following:\n",
    " - Vertices consist of 1, 2, 3\n",
    " - Edge consists of (1, 2) and (1, 2)\n",
    "Say, you'd like to calculate the eventual beliefs of all the vertices in this graph and you start from Node a. Following the definition defined in the assignment brief, then you have to calculate the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "b(x_{1} = F) = \\phi(x_{1} = F) \\times m_{12}(x_{1} = F)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $m_{12}$ represents the message from Vertice 2 to Vertice 1 (order swapped a little from the assignment brief). However, we also note that in the recursive message step, Vertice 2 has neighbours 1 and 3. In other words, we need to calculate $m_{23}$. In the recursive step defined in the lecture notes, \n",

    "\n",
    "Observe that $\\sum\\phi(x_{i})\\psi(x_{i}, x_{j})$ is a constant time step, but in the case of vertice 2, using this formula, we need to find $m_{23}(x_{2} = T)$ and $m_{23}(x_{2} = F)$. However, this step is repeated twice because $m_{12}(x_{1} = T)$ computes it once, then $m_{12}(x_{1} = F)$ computes it again. This repetition is inefficient and we can memoize it so that the time complexity is drastically reduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before moving on to the next part, allow me to define some of the basic classes and objects we need to solve a question. In this code block, we have the class **Influence**, which stores the respective $\\psi$ values between edges. This allows users to either set a value for $\\psi$, or let the value be randomized. In this implementation,\n",

As per the Influence, one can either choose to set the coefficient themselves or let the computer set a randomized one. In addition, it contains the attribute **label** which helps when finalizing when confirming the result of which belief it should belong to: T or F. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, **self.link** is a dictionary attribute containing all immediate neighbours it is connected to as keys. The values would then be the Influence, the $\\psi$ that is between them. This helps later on significantly in the algorithm."
