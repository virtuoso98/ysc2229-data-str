    "Before starting on this question, I'd like to define the following basic objects first. Firstly, i define the constants Red and Black which constitute the basis of Red-Black Trees. Secondly, I define the class RBNode which represents a Node in the Red-Black Tree. This stores the following attributes: the time (in 24h format), its ID number, its parent (self.p), left and right child, colour (red by default) and info, which will be covered later when we talk about augmenting the Red-Black Tree in order to output requests in **O(log n)**. In addition, I will store the time object, which is needed to store the airplane times. "

    "In order to do this question, we need a binary search algorithm that operates in **O(log n)** time. However, this is not easy since we need to output a range. Therefore, we best we can do is to populate the all subtrees with information about itself as a flattened list so this can be easily called at O(1) time. In addition, we need to be a little bit creative with our algorithm. Here is an intuition behind this algorithm: \n",

    "**out_request** - it takes in a **red-black tree, h(starting time), min(starting time), s(starting time), h(end time), min(end time), s(end time)** in order. There are 7 arguments here, so please input cautiously. Firstly, this function defines a start and end Time() object. Afterwards, it traverses the tree from its root node. Trying to find a node with time within the range while it has not encountered a NIL node. If this is possible, then the while loop breaks prematurely. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the time is earlier than the range stated, the node traverses to the left. If the time is later than the range stated, the node traverses to the right. This repeats until either the node is a NIL node or it terminates after finding something in range. If the node is a NIL node, then there are no times in the red black tree within the range, if which it returns None. However, the fun begins when it starts to mop up information to find the left and right bound. The right child will be inputted to **print_req_right** while the left child will be inputted to **print_req_left**, \n",
    "\n",
    "In **print_req_right**, the tree tries to traverse all the way to the right until it finds the first timing later than the latest time in the time range. However, as it tries to find it, it prints information about \n",
    " - itself, since it is still within the time range\n",
    " - left subtree augmented information, since all these timings are earlier than this parent node and therefore within the range.\n",

    " - right subtree augmented information, since all these timings are later than this parent node and therefore within the range.\n",

    "**(a) Argue or justify that the problem can be solved using dynamic programming.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. This is because of the overlapping substructures of the subproblems. In other words, subproblems share subsubproblems. If dynamic programming is not used, then the algorithm becomes inefficient because we have to compute the same subsubproblem multiple times. However, dynamic programing allows us to solve these subsubproblems just once and store its answer in a table, which can be queried, making our algorithm much more efficient. \n",

    "For a concrete example, consider the undirected graph consisting of the following:\n",
    " - Vertices consist of 1, 2, 3\n",
    " - Edge consists of (1, 2) and (1, 2)\n",
    "Say, you'd like to calculate the eventual beliefs of all the vertices in this graph and you start from Node a. Following the definition defined in the assignment brief, then you have to calculate the following:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $m_{12}$ represents the message from Vertice 2 to Vertice 1 (order swapped a little from the assignment brief). However, we also note that in the recursive message step, Vertice 2 has neighbours 1 and 3. In other words, we need to calculate $m_{23}$. In the recursive step defined in the lecture notes, \n",

    "Observe that $\\sum\\phi(x_{i})\\psi(x_{i}, x_{j})$ is a constant time step, but in the case of vertice 2, using this formula, we need to find $m_{23}(x_{2} = T)$ and $m_{23}(x_{2} = F)$. However, this step is repeated twice because $m_{12}(x_{1} = T)$ computes it once, then $m_{12}(x_{1} = F)$ computes it again. This repetition is inefficient and we can memoize it so that the time complexity is drastically reduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before moving on to the next part, allow me to define some of the basic classes and objects we need to solve a question. In this code block, we have the class **Influence**, which stores the respective $\\psi$ values between edges. This allows users to either set a value for $\\psi$, or let the value be randomized.

As per the Influence, one can either choose to set the coefficient themselves or let the computer set a randomized one. In addition, it contains the attribute **label** which helps when finalizing when confirming the result of which belief it should belong to: T or F. \n",

    "**(a) Write python code to implement the Huffman coding to compress any given strings. Specifically, given an input of sentences stored in a possibly long array, your final output is the binary digits representing the input sentences in an array. Your second output is the binary digit representation of every character in the input array.**\n",

    "In this question, we have to implement the Huffman Code algorithm to efficiently compress input sentences in a lossless manner. Before starting on this question, it would be good to define some fundamental data structures first. We first define the class **HuffmanNode** first. this is the Class that is described in the lecture notes as the Huffman Tree with a left and right node. However, we have another class **self.table**. This is for the root node to store the Huffman Code for the Tree. \n",

    "In the lecture notes, it is mentioned that the HuffmanNode is done using a Minimum Priority Queue. I choose to implement this using a Min-Heap data structure explained in Chapter 6. Other than that, there isn't anything really special. The only catch here is that in the zero-th index of this heap, I create a Huffman Node with value **-sys.maxsize**(multiplied by -1). This makes it easier to refer to the indexes of the array without pesky plus/minus 1s to the index. Other than that, the Minimum Priority Queue is done in terms of the frequency of which the characters appear in a sentence. \n",
