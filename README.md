# :gear Introductory Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository shows code that I have done for this course. The assignments and exercises can be found [here](https://tanrobby.github.io/). Other than the regular leetcode, this was the other course that I used to hone my coding skills.

Interestingly, all exercises are done in jupyter notebook by request of the professor. Please don't ask me why :cold_sweat:
